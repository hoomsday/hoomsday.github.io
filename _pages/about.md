I am currently working as theory researcher at Theory Lab, Huawei. I got my Ph.D. degree of computational mathematics in June, 2020, at Peking University, China. My supervisor is Prof. Sihong Shao. 

Research interests
===
My major research interest is the mathematical theory of particle methods, as well as their applications in solving high-dimensional PDEs arsing from the quantum physics and finances.

The concept of particle method is closely related to the Monte Carlo methods. However, the usage of particle methods does not merely involve sampling process, but actually they are integrated applications of stochastic process, numerical mathematics, number theory, statistical learning, combinatorics, harmonic analysis and so on.
