I am currently working as theortical researcher at Theory Lab,
Central Research Institute, 2012 Labs, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.. I got my Ph.D. degree of computational mathematics in June, 2020, at Peking University, China. My supervisor is Prof. Sihong Shao. 

Research interests
===
My major research interest is about graph algorithm, graph data mining, and vector database. 

What's new
===
Recently, our team's approximate nearest neighbor search method qsg-ngt acheived the best performance on ANN-Benchmark (https://ann-benchmarks.com/).

We propose PR-GPT (Pre-trained & Refined Graph ParTitioning) based
on a novel pre-training & refinement paradigm, which won the streaming graph partition track championship on graph challenge organized by MIT.
